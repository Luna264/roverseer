                        SOJOURNER

                    <h4>
                        Soujourner was the first ever robot to land on Martian soil. Its main purpose was to show a possible cheap method for taking science tools to Mars. Landing in Ares Vallis, an area that scientists thought contained rocks from a flood, Sojourner returned nearly 550 images, while its lander returned 16,500. Overall, the mission was a sucesss, as the robots brought back valuable information about the weather, geology, atmosphere, the past of Mars, and most importantly, was the foundation for all Mars rovers today.

                    <h4>
                        Spirit and Oppurtunity were twin rovers that were sent to opposite sides of Mars, intending on researching the existence of liquid water and life that may have existed on Mars. Oppurtunity lasted significantly longer, traveled farther, and took more images than Spirit, but they both had achivements. Oppurtunity discovered that Mars was once covered in salty water by finding desposits of a material that usually forms in water. Spirit found 90% pure silica in soil, suggesting the existence of hot springs on Mars. On earth, steam vents contain life. This discovery brought closer the idea that Mars may have once supported life.

                    <h4>
                       Curiosity was, at the time it was launched, the biggest and most capable rover ever created. Its purpose was to find out if Mars ever had the right enviornment to support life, similarly to other rovers. It contains a geology lab, a rock vaporizing laser, and is about the size of an SUV. It landed at Gale Crater and immediately began analyzing rocks, soil, and air, using its drill to collect rock samples. And, after 13 years, Curiosity is still operational today!

                        Launched in 2020, Perserverance's goal is also to search for signs of past life on Mars. Its possible that the samples it is collecting now may be brought back to Earth in another mission. The rocks that it finds could preserve ancient microbal life. Along with Perserverance came its helicopter, Ingenunity, the first aircraft to achieve controlled flight on other planet. After passing its intended life span dramatically, it became a scout for rovers, and has made 72 flights total.
