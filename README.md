# roverseer
**what is this**

this is roverseer, a simple website in which you get can get a brief overview on some of the major mars missions

**why?**

i came up with this idea a long time ago and i wanted it to use api's and be more fleshed out. realizing that that was not as easy to learn as i thought, and that i also had no time to do it, i settled with making a simple static website and making it look nice.

**how?**

this project was made in VSCode using HTML and CSS.

**struggles**

its been a hot second since i last coded a website, and by that i mean about 4 years. there was a lot of information to learn in one day (more on that later) and so the mistakes i made kept me stumped for longer because i was absolutely clueless. alsooo, yea, one day. i dont think i expected how tight my schedule would be school first started, so i def did not plan right for this. time is, once again, the biggest issue i had with this project. however, i am pretty satisfied for the way it turned out!! i think that, someday, i might go back to crash course and this project and work on them to get them to their full potential.
